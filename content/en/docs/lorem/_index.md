## A Holiday Party

cartography seems the strangest science today  
the theme of sunday's puzzle is in tunes   
from a  playlist called autumn in new york and   
i made pastries to put on display and  
i am somebody to come home to

i imagine your cold wind city,   
your parents basement, your now home office,  
with the vhs player where you'd play tapes of   
your parents proudest moments, and you smiling big (so small),   
and my parents having never recorded a school play,   
and your parents thinking maybe you'd be something more and   
since you didn't bear the burden of your father's name,   
maybe you'd not bear his penchant for getting high  
and being found in places where you should not be

do you remember when we'd wake entangled  
with noses all sore from cocaine and eskimo kisses  
protected by big doors, all grey, in those mass  
produced expensive student apartments-- we couldn't  
pretend to not love our shitty modern furniture &  
meeting in the shitty modern elevator to ask about  
our days and think of what we'd create, if given our lifetime;  
the caveat being my reluctance to adjourn to our room where  
you'd wait like a lady, desperate to coo, and like a man,  
desperate for exactly what men are desperate for

i felt there would be days like today in my bones, back then  
but on the last day of the last year there was a last dance  
which only i knew to be true, and you, sobered with  
prophetic palm lines and distrust, believed this to be  
our life-- an infinite record skip, me as your queen of  
the smoke shop next door to that purple apartment building  
where we squeezed all of your furniture into little rooms

days you are sick, we let the bed  
take the lead, and you, like all men do,  
sleep like its the back of your hand, yet  
distinguished are you in your constancy &  
devotion to slipping in & slipping back in

you leave once for cigarettes cuz the weed  
we smoked had you seeing things again and  
i remember the dream you had about your  
father and sex and i remember you at three  
your dad coming home drunk, and i'd often  
think about your mom and if she were scared  
as she was the day you were collected and  
ushered to your old new home

i, like my movie,  
cried as i suffocated myself with that red flannel  
you got on black friday that smelled like the  
cologne of who you wanted to be for me, and 

i, like a movie i'd never seen,   
tried to talk you out of your martian initiation ceremony--   
swearing upon biblical records of intention versus impact and 

i, like your probable mother,   
wasn't sure if you'd hurt me  
your fathers blue eyes sitting blankly on your face,   
mine fixed upon your fists and sob-induced snot,   
belonging to neither my mom nor my dad, belonging to the poem   
i'm always word-searching for, that i’m expected to finish soon because  
i have the nicest thesaurus, in my nicest little library   
that i woke to this morning, on a day i always knew i'd have
## Lists of Titles
-&nbsp;a list of titles  
-&nbsp;poetry on 1:35 am  
-&nbsp;16 cans of wine and loops in time  
-&nbsp;the abandonment of disorder and lists  
-&nbsp;playing victim to circumstance: a traveler&#39;s guide  
-&nbsp;ok, fuck it -- poetry on allowances, grasps, and directives  
-&nbsp;the specificity of symbolic birds  
-&nbsp;questions about free use corn and a personal statement on sexy dissociation  
-&nbsp;the explanation of tremors in a stillborn heart  
-&nbsp;it wasn&#39;t me, then i realized that wasn&#39;t my biggest fear  
-&nbsp;it wasn&#39;t me, and then i remembered how to care about the right things  
-&nbsp;containers of things i&#39;ve killed - an exercise in mortuary rightness  
-&nbsp;little boxes on the hillside, little vases of excavations of both my valleys and assentions  
-&nbsp;the hydrangeas are doing well, except for and despite the weathering


I write you to confess that I miss you,    
to discover if I've lost it,  
so you’ll say I still glow.  
## Medical Operation Through Which I Am Unfazed by Your Frequent Distance

I wipe clean my memory of your touch, the point of your gaze.  
Processional forgetting onsets upon arrival to the home of just myself.  
I fight for memory lapse until you sit across from me, a day you set.  
We meet for the first time again and again—*o, how long it’s been*.  
You cross your legs and I watch where your feet land.  
Had I not been lobotomized, I’d be screaming  
*I wish you’d miss me.*

Misery loves company and so please join me  
in my exile of withdrawal and rumination on  
inches that should have been removed and  
minutes that should have been there, too.

My body can no longer withstand this operation.  
The anesthetic, the amnesia  
in such proximity, at such frequency.  
Our weeks close in on each other,  
we touch less than ever.

I want to remember your friend that overdosed and  
the way you sit when you drive—naked and assuming.  
I want to remember the title of every book,  
the name of every philosopher, the writing  
on post-it notes, the quotes on mugs.  
I ask you to a movie—the most heinous act of all.  
How lucky are you for the luxury of choice?  
I want to spend the night with nobody else.  
I only want to come home to you.  
There is no other satisfaction,  
and, erasure, even as it guts me.
