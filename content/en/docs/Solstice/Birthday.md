**What I wanted to say to you is that life feels like a sick fucking joke.**  

You would tell me that it isn’t, and I would reluctantly agree, because we both know about pain and the directions in which it expands-- ways we both know we cannot fully grasp. We all have pain, it’s all a little different, but in all situations it is still just that-- pain. It is through pain that we grow, and as living creatures on the earth, we must grow. There are corners to turn and homeruns to hit and knees to scrape. Men to harass you, apartments to move, illness to catch, cancer to — whatever.  I still smile, we all still smile, and in all endings, everything turns out okay. Nothing is for naught. 

The world will eat at us but we grin as we grow as we gripe as we’re low. 

We endure for tenacity's sake. The richness that lives in our lessons learned. Today, I feel smug about my various rock bottoms, which taught me to have faith that in a year I’ll look back on whatever rocky water and how little I knew about the growth it would catalyze. So, if I had told you that life feels like a sick fucking joke or that it is unfair to specifically me, I’d just be being dramatic, like I always am. 

You just don’t know when it’s coming. I’ll weather any storm but be no less scared of it, and I wish it would rain. I hope my mom doesn’t have a new cancer growth. I hope I didn’t give her a virus when her white blood cell count is so low that she can’t leave the house in the first place, and she can’t get off of her chemo to give the count a chance to rise, because of the potential cancer growth. What if she dies while I am in isolation, and I can’t be there, and the last text she ever sends me is “ok” and there are so many good parts left that we never get to have, and I don’t get to make peace with that? I feel it in the front of my stomach, pushing itself down on my gut and flittering through my lungs and shoving its fist up my esophagus, punching out my throat. 

I’m above everything, in trees I still haven't had the chance to greet, and I will be here for five days, roaming my treehouse, getting high, sitting still, trying to swallow. Unseen, unsaved, unsettled. There is no distraction. There doesn’t have to be. Do you think if I practice a very intentional solitude, I will struggle with it and persevere, and come out on the other side knowing something valuable and important?

My dad carried a microwave and groceries up four flights of stairs and gasping for breath, red in the face, he asked me how I’m feeling. I was too nervous to speak because I thought I would sound too healthy compared to his hyperventilation, and he'd think he has had made this physical sacrifice for naught. And I mostly don’t wanna look at him because his panting compassion feels vulnerable, and now I have this microwave and foods he knew I would like that he purchased even though I did not ask for them. 

This love is so big and bright and indisputable, I can hardly bear looking at it in the face--  
To be loved wholly and without artifice, never a stipulation, never a transaction.  
To be cared about, tended to, fought for, doted on, supported by.  
To recieve love that is just an _“of course.”_

No, nobody is going to bring me my favorite food. I'm not going to be saved.  
But what I can do is set myself up in a nice space, and get all of the things I need. Fun activities too — like a sketch pad, my vases, a snack, and a mother fucking beer-- so what!  
 I will catch myself and lean in, too, and think about routine and do nothing sometimes. It’s going to be fine. I’m going to buy things. Yes, it’s true. I’m going to write throughout the day. Make it this really casual thing. Easy practice to practice. I will want these words later. 

**Here’s a conversation I just had:**

**Me:** Well, it’s just you and me now.  
**Me:** Finally. I love when we retreat into each other. I love ending my night with you.  
**Me:** You’ve had a hard day, and it’s your birthday, and you’ve got COVID, and your mom is having new cancer issues — this is a hard day. you’ve been tough, even if you don’t feel that way. How can we take care of you?  
**Me:** I don’t want to take care of myself. I don’t want you to take care of me.  
**Me:** I love you. I just want you to feel better. You’ll feel better when you’re clean. When you get yourself sorted. There’s still time in the day for it to be a little better.  
**Me:** You’re right. I’d like to shower. I’d like it to be a really good one.  
**Me:** What makes a shower good?   
**Me:** I don’t know. 

Sometimes I reference a list I made for best shower best practices that I spent hours researching before a company holiday party. Once, I got high and had a good one. The rest of the times I showered high I was afraid I was being watched. Sometimes I think the trick is to remember you’ll never have it figured out. Expecting a period of peace will always bite you. Such is life. 

I can’t really eat the birthday cake because of my cavities, but I suppose we will keep each other comfortable.
