I’m not sure where to began, but I’m not sure if I ever have. 

We open where it all starts. A dining room table where my aunt conducted her existence, a bud-vase centerpiece from my grandma stocked full of dead flowers that still have the audacity to be colorful. A craft beer at 3:00 PM, an Ensure at 8 AM, and another right now, because I forgot how badly I want to take care of myself. I do. I do. Oh god, I do. The captain has been yanked out of her sinking ship, the one she swore she’d die on, the one she swore she wasn’t drowning alongside. You don’t know your disarray until you are looking at it from above— some heavenly place where you’re floating in all white, saved by some God that has the same name. 

You’re looking over a shoebox diorama full of red strings, beer cans, tip toes, weed resin; and you realize you were never able to translate that existence into the pain it really was, something you never could have realized until whatever death grabbed you by the neck ascends you to posthumous glory. The death that will happen a million times over, if you’re lucky. 

I picked a wall color to be happy, and I was for awhile. I like the new one more. I imagine one day I’ll have a room that is dark green, or light pink, and I will be shocked I ever found such saviorhood within these sage-ish something grey-white walls.
