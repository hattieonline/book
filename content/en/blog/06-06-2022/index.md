# crutch sonnet

i do not want the breakthrough on my own  
i won't meet god without a beer in hand  
let me sit in disgust and hear birds sing,  
let me remember the girl that i am


write poems about not writing poems  
forget to ever go outside for air  
you're writing the way that you used to  
without substance and desperate for flair

picture me, please, i'm desperate for it  
opening unmoved boxes trying to find   
my paint, all the renditions of my face,  
the self portraiture of my mothers spine

i will smoke and laugh at my poetry  
i will be sad that i'm no longer here  
i will see ghosts in my periphery
